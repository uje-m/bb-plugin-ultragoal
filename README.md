# UltraGoal

A [BB](https://getbb.app) plugin that adds one provider-neutral durable UltraGoal system on Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Claude Code, and Pi.

The root thread is the orchestrator. It keeps a durable objective, a requirement plan, and a crew of named subagents. Workers implement slices. Optional verifiers check finished work on a second model.

## Install

After the community marketplace listing is approved:

```bash
bb plugin install ultragoal@bb-community
```

Until then, install the tagged release from this repository:

```bash
bb plugin install 'git:https://github.com/braedonsaunders/bb-plugin-ultragoal.git@v0.28.0'
```

Or from a local checkout:

```bash
cd bb-plugin-ultragoal
npm install
bb plugin install . --yes
```

Reload after source edits with `bb plugin reload ultragoal`.

## Use

In a thread on any supported provider:

```text
/ultragoal Ship the ledger export with tests and a reviewable PR
```

Other commands:

```text
/ultragoal                  # status
/ultragoal edit <objective> # change the contract
/ultragoal pause
/ultragoal resume
/ultragoal clear
```

CLI (from a thread, or pass `--thread`):

```bash
bb ultragoal
bb ultragoal set "Ship the ledger export"
bb ultragoal pause
bb ultragoal resume
bb ultragoal clear
```

The UltraGoal pane lists **Now** (expand a row for the live worker), **Up next** (blocked work gets a chip), and **Previous**. Its headline metrics distinguish **Work items** from **Defects** because related defects can share one repair item. The plan is read-only in the pane; the agent updates it. Settings control verification, verifier and worker models, progress-chat interval, worker slots, auto-continue, remediation capacity, repository integration, local provider accounting, standing worker rules, and the token budget.

The only root agent controls are `ultragoal_start`, `ultragoal_state`, `ultragoal_patch`, and `ultragoal_finish` on every provider. They operate on UltraGoal's durable plugin state; provider-native goal state is unrelated.

## How it runs

The split follows the research in [docs/architecture-research.md](docs/architecture-research.md): the model plans, deterministic code schedules.

1. The orchestrator calls `ultragoal_patch` with new or changed work as a dependency-DAG patch: every work item carries `files` (its disjoint file scope), `check` (a runnable done-gate), and `deps` (what it waits for; `[]` = ready now). Omitted work remains durable, batches cap at 200, and `ultragoal_state` pages large plans 40 rows at a time by default.
2. The ready-queue scheduler staffs one fresh worker per ready work item — deps complete, file scopes disjoint — up to the worker limit (default 5). Assigned workers occupy a slot until their item closes, including idle Codex turns. Pause stops the whole crew and parks in-progress work.
3. Hunt/audit work streams defects through `report_finding`. Exact-file related defects share repair work; new repair work is created until remediation capacity (the persisted `maxOpenFindings` setting) is full. Overflow waits durably and backfills oldest-first as capacity frees, including after restart. Open defects block completion.
4. Workers stay hidden and implement only their item, reporting evidence (commit SHAs, check output). Every brief carries a generalized quality bar ([templates/goals/worker_brief.md](templates/goals/worker_brief.md)) — reuse-first, complete production-grade work, clean cutover, honest gates run as the exact pinned command and only when host load allows, crew-safe atomic commits rebased onto the goal's named integration branch — with the repo's own AGENTS.md taking precedence. They do not call `ultragoal_finish` or rewrite the parent plan.
5. When verification is on (default), a second model audits each finished worker. The orchestrator should not mark that work item complete until `VERIFY_PASS`.
6. If several minutes pass with no visible main-thread update, the plugin nudges the orchestrator to post one.

## Data access and repository effects

UltraGoal makes no direct outbound network requests of its own. It never pushes a Git remote from a background timer or from automatic slice integration.

Safety-sensitive behavior is off by default and shown in each goal's pane:

- **Automatic slice integration** optionally squash-merges a completed managed worker branch into the goal's base branch. With it off, completed work remains on its worker branch for manual integration.
- **Merged worktree cleanup** optionally removes a clean managed worktree and force-deletes its worker branch, but only after the branch's work is represented on the base branch. It does nothing unless automatic integration is enabled.
- **Local provider session accounting** optionally reads Claude Code JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects`, Codex JSONL files under `~/.codex/sessions`, Cursor's `state.vscdb` and session `store.db` files, and OpenCode's `opencode.db`. UltraGoal extracts token totals and native-child session metadata, stores only aggregate metadata in its own database, and transmits none of the source data.

Automatic approval of agent requests is separately off by default. Workers use BB's normal approval mode and verifiers are hardcoded to that mode. Standing worker rules can be activated, edited, or cleared only by a user action in the UltraGoal pane; the agent-facing CLI cannot write them. The pane records when the rules were saved and that they came from a user action. Agent-authored work-item and finding `check` strings remain visible as plan metadata but are never inserted into another agent's prompt; workers choose verification independently from trusted repository instructions, and linked finding evidence is explicitly labeled untrusted data.

Every durable UltraGoal root carries exactly one UltraGoal pill beside its title in BB's thread list until the goal is cleared. A lifecycle-scoped content-script stylesheet targets only those root row IDs; it installs no observer, mutates no host nodes, and does not replace the user's chosen thread list. Workers and verifiers are created with BB's supported hidden-thread visibility, so the left sidebar stays at one root row. Subagents belonging to ordinary non-UltraGoal threads remain visible.

## Plugin compatibility

Do not install UltraGoal alongside the separate `goal` plugin. Both contribute orchestration instructions to the same thread lifecycle, so enabling both can produce competing control systems. UltraGoal does not inspect, hide, or modify threads owned by `goal`.

`ultragoal_patch` is the only plan source: there is no provider-native todo mirror, prose report parsing, or legacy staffing path. It atomically patches only supplied rows, so a one-item status change never retransmits a 1,000-item UltraGoal. Every ready item is the scheduler's to staff.

## Root transfer

An unfinished UltraGoal can move to a replacement root in the same project and environment without changing its workers or durable history:

```bash
bb ultragoal transfer-root <source-thread> <target-thread> --dry-run
bb ultragoal transfer-root <source-thread> <target-thread>
```

The target must be an idle empty root with no UltraGoal-owned rows or worker identity collision. Transfer uses a durable, restartable journal: it stops both runtimes, atomically moves plugin-owned state, archives the source, reparents only live direct workers, verifies parity, then wakes the target once. Existing worker/provider pins, settings, tokens, plan, defect metadata, decisions, and cursors are preserved.
